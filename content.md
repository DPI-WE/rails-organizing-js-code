# JavaScript level up with Stimulus.js
In our previous lessons, we've seen how [JavaScript](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/203-minimal-js) can enhance the interactivity of our Rails applications using [Ajax with Rails Unobtrusive JavaScript (UJS)](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/204-rails-unobtrusive-ajax). Now, let's dive deeper into organizing our JavaScript code, Rails JavaScript helper methods, understanding the lifecycle methods, and briefly touch on the JavaScript and CSS asset pipeline. Finally, we'll implement a practical example by adding interactive features to a Ruby on Rails application using two approaches: Vanilla JavaScript and Stimulus.js.

## Understanding JavaScript Organization in Rails
Typically, JavaScript files in Rails are placed under `app/javascript`. As your application grows, keeping your javascript code in this directory with a clear structure keeps your codebase manageable. Clear organization also helps team members (and instructors ðŸ¥¹) to understand and contribute to the codebase effectively.

### Directory Structure
Rails 7 provides a standard way to organize your JavaScript files. Hereâ€™s a typical structure:

```
app/
  javascript/
    channels/
    controllers/
    custom/
      your_custom_script.js
    application.js
```
- **Channels**: Used for ActionCable related files.
- **Controllers**: Stimulus controllers are typically placed here.
- **Custom**: Create custom directories like `custom/` or `util/` for your specific scripts.
- **application.js**: The JavaScript manifest file. You can think of it as a central directory or index of your JavaScript files.

## Importing ES6 Modules
ES6 modules allow you to break your JavaScript into smaller, reusable components.
- Create separate modules in the `javascript/` directory.
- Export functions, objects, or classes from these modules.
- Import them in `app/javascript/application.js` or any other module where you need them.

Example:

```javascript
// app/custom/hello.js
export function sayHello(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

// app/javascript/application.js
import { sayHello } from './custom/hello';

console.log(sayHello('Alice'));
```

## `javascript_include_tag`
The `javascript_include_tag` is a Rails helper that includes JavaScript files into your HTML templates. Typically used in your layout file:

```erb
<%= javascript_include_tag 'application', 'data-turbo-track': 'reload' %>
```

This line includes `application.js`, which is your main JavaScript file. Rails handles the compilation and packaging of all the linked JavaScript files.

## Understanding Lifecycle Methods in JavaScript
Lifecycle methods are crucial in understanding how your JavaScript interacts with the DOM.

### The `DOMContentLoaded` Event
Triggers when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed.
Does not wait for stylesheets, images, and subframes to finish loading.

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', (event) => {
  // Your code goes here
});
```

### The `load` Event
Triggered when the entire page, including all dependent resources (like images), is fully loaded.

```javascript
window.addEventListener('load', (event) => {
  // Your code goes here
});
```

### The `beforeunload` and `unload` Events
- `beforeunload` can be used to alert the user before leaving a page.
- `unload` triggers when the document or a child resource is being unloaded.

## Understanding Webpacker and Importmaps in Rails 7
Rails 7 offers two different approaches for handling JavaScript: Webpacker and Importmaps. Both have distinct characteristics suitable for different project needs.

### Webpacker
Webpacker is a tool that integrates Webpack, a popular JavaScript bundler, into Rails. It allows for advanced JavaScript processing, including the use of ES6 modules, JSX for React, and integration with NPM packages. In essence, Webpacker prepares all JavaScript assets on the server side before they are sent to the client (browser).

#### Key Points:
- **Ideal for Complex Applications**: Best suited for applications that require complex JavaScript, such as Single Page Applications (SPAs).
- **NPM Package Management**: Easily manage and include various NPM packages.
- **Preprocessing Assets**: Supports asset preprocessing, including stylesheets and images.
- **Configuration**: Offers more configuration options, allowing for customized setups.

#### How to Tell If a Project Is Using Webpacker:
- Check for `webpacker` in the `Gemfile`.
- Look for `app/javascript/packs/application.js` or similar JavaScript pack files.
- Presence of `config/webpacker.yml` file.

### Importmaps
Importmaps is a newer feature in Rails 7 that simplifies JavaScript management by leveraging the native module-loading capabilities of modern browsers. Instead of compiling and bundling modules server-side, Importmaps allows the browser to load JavaScript modules directly at runtime.

#### Key Points:
- **Simplicity and Convention**: Ideal for applications with simpler JavaScript needs, following Rails conventions.
- **No Node.js or Webpack**: Simplifies setup by removing the dependency on Node.js or Webpack during development.
- **Direct ES6 Module Import**: Uses the browser's native capability to import ES6 modules.
- **Rails-Like Approach**: Emphasizes convention over configuration, aligning well with the Rails philosophy.

#### How to Tell If a Project Is Using Importmaps:
- Look for `importmap-rails` in the `Gemfile`.
- Presence of `config/importmap.rb` file.
- JavaScript files are typically located in `app/javascript` without the packs subdirectory.
- In `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`, the `javascript_importmap_tags` helper is used instead of `javascript_pack_tag`.

### Deciding Between Webpacker and Importmaps
- Use Webpacker if your project demands complex JavaScript functionalities, you're integrating frameworks like React or Vue, or you need to manage a variety of NPM packages.
- Use Importmaps if your project requires simpler JavaScript enhancements, you prefer less configuration, and you want to utilize modern browser capabilities for managing JavaScript.

In summary, Webpacker and Importmaps cater to different project requirements in Rails 7. Webpacker provides a robust solution for complex JavaScript needs, while Importmaps offers a simpler, more Rails-centric approach for managing JavaScript modules.

## JavaScript and CSS Asset Pipeline
Rails 7 supports the asset pipeline, which is a framework to concatenate and minify or compress JavaScript and CSS assets.

Place your JavaScript files in `app/assets/javascripts/`.

<!-- how is this different from node.js require? -->
Use `//= require` statements in application.js to include them.

<!-- TODO: add more context. maybe mention turbo? -->
## Turbolinks and JavaScript
Turbolinks can make your application faster but requires a different approach in handling JavaScript:

Use the `turbolinks:load` event instead of DOMContentLoaded.
Remember to clean up or re-initialize JavaScript on page changes.

## Practical Example: Toggling Text Visibility
We'll implement a feature where users can toggle the visibility of a paragraph of text on a webpage.

### Part 1: Vanilla JavaScript Approach
The vanilla approach involves directly manipulating the DOM using JavaScript. It's straightforward but requires managing event listeners and ensuring the DOM is fully loaded before script execution.

<!--
- Direct DOM Manipulation: The script directly manipulates DOM elements using getElementById and classList.
- Event Listeners: Manually adding event listeners in the JavaScript file.
- Script Initialization: Ensuring that scripts are initialized on DOMContentLoaded.
- Loose Coupling with HTML: The JavaScript is somewhat decoupled from the HTML structure, relying on id and class selectors. 
-->


#### Step 1: Creating the View
Include a paragraph and a button:

```erb
<!-- app/views/pages/home.html.erb -->
<p id="hidden-text" class="hidden-text">
  This is hidden text.
</p>

<button id="toggle-button">Toggle Visibility</button>
```

#### Step 2: Adding JavaScript
Create a function to toggle the visibility and add an event listener to the button:

```javascript
// app/javascript/custom/toggle_visibility.js

function toggleTextVisibility() {
  const text = document.getElementById('hidden-text');
  text.classList.toggle('hidden-text');
}

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const button = document.getElementById('toggle-button');
  button.addEventListener('click', toggleTextVisibility);
});
```

#### Step 3: Including JavaScript in Application
Import the script:

```javascript
// app/javascript/packs/application.js
import "../custom/toggle_visibility"
```

#### Step 4: CSS
Add the .hidden-text class:

```css
/* app/assets/stylesheets/application.css */

.hidden-text {
  display: none;
}
```

### Part 2: Stimulus.js Approach
Stimulus.js is a modest JavaScript framework designed for Rails applications. It enhances HTML by connecting elements to JavaScript objects in a structured and organized manner. It's beneficial for its ease of use, integration with Rails conventions, and clarity in connecting HTML to JavaScript.

<!--
- Declarative Interaction: Stimulus allows for a more declarative approach, connecting HTML and JavaScript via data attributes.
- Controllers and Targets: JavaScript functionalities are encapsulated in controllers and targets, making the code more organized and maintainable.
- Automatic Initialization: Stimulus automatically initializes controllers and their actions without needing to manually set up event listeners or wait for DOMContentLoaded.
- Stronger Coupling: There's a stronger coupling between the HTML structure and JavaScript functionality, making it clearer how elements are intended to behave.
-->

#### Step 1: Setting Up Stimulus
Run the command to install Stimulus, if not already done:

1. Add the `stimulus-rails` gem to your `Gemfile`: `gem 'stimulus-rails'`
2. Run `./bin/bundle install`.
3. Run `./bin/rails stimulus:install`

#### Step 2: Creating a Stimulus Controller
Generate a Stimulus controller:

```bash
./bin/rails generate stimulus toggle
```

Edit the controller:

```javascript
// app/javascript/controllers/toggle_controller.js

import { Controller } from "stimulus";

export default class extends Controller {
  static targets = ["text"]

  toggle() {
    this.textTarget.classList.toggle('hidden-text');
  }
}
```

#### Step 3: Adjusting the View
Update the HTML to use Stimulus:

```erb
<!-- app/views/pages/home.html.erb -->

<div data-controller="toggle">
  <p data-toggle-target="text" class="hidden-text">
    This is hidden text.
  </p>

  <button data-action="click->toggle#toggle">Toggle Visibility</button>
</div>
```
