# JavaScript level up with Stimulus.js
In our previous lessons, we've seen how [JavaScript](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/203-minimal-js) can enhance the interactivity of our Rails applications using [Ajax with Rails Unobtrusive JavaScript (UJS)](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/204-rails-unobtrusive-ajax). Building on this foundation, we're now set to delve deeper into the organization of JavaScript code and three distinct approaches to managing JavaScript in a Rails environment. To bring these concepts to life, we'll implement a practical example, implementing interactive features in a Ruby on Rails application using both Vanilla JavaScript and Stimulus.js.

## Understanding JavaScript Organization in Rails
Typically, JavaScript files in Rails are placed under `app/javascript`. As your application grows, keeping your javascript code in this directory with a clear structure keeps your codebase manageable. Clear organization also helps team members (and instructors ðŸ¥¹) to understand and contribute to the codebase effectively.

### Directory Structure
Rails 7 provides a standard way to organize your JavaScript files. Hereâ€™s a typical structure:

```
app/
  javascript/
    channels/
    controllers/
    custom/
      your_custom_script.js
    application.js
```
- **Channels**: Used for [ActionCable](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_cable_overview.html) related files.
- **Controllers**: [Stimulus](https://github.com/hotwired/stimulus-rails) controllers are typically placed here.
- **Custom**: Create custom directories like `custom/` or `util/` for your specific scripts.
- **application.js**: The JavaScript manifest file. You can think of it as a central directory or index of your JavaScript files.

<aside>
### ES6 Modules
ES6 (also known as ECMAScript 6) is a recent update to the JavaScript programming language. ES6 modules allow you to break your JavaScript into smaller, reusable components. One approach to organize JavaScript in your project is to create separate modules in the `javascript/` directory. Then, export functions, objects, or classes from these modules and import them in `app/javascript/application.js` or any other module where you need them.

Example:

```javascript
// app/custom/hello.js
export function sayHello(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

// app/javascript/application.js
import { sayHello } from './custom/hello';

console.log(sayHello('Alice'));
```

## JavaScript Management in Rails: the Asset Pipeline and Bundling
Rails 7 offers several approaches for handling JavaScript, each catering to different needs: the traditional [Asset Pipeline](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html) with [Import Maps](https://github.com/rails/importmap-rails), [Bundling](https://github.com/rails/jsbundling-rails), and API-only approach. Understanding the differences and use cases of each helps in choosing the right tool for your project.

### Asset Pipeline: Sprockets with Import Maps

The [Asset Pipeline](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html) is a Rails framework that handles the delivery of JavaScript and CSS assets. This done using techniques to concatenate, minify, and cache JavaScript and CSS assets, optimizing them for production.

<aside>
  **Minification** is the process of removing unnecessary characters from source code (like whitespace, newline characters, and comments) without changing its functionality. This is done to reduce the size of the assets (JavaScript, CSS, etc.), which in turn decreases the amount of data that needs to be transferred over the network to the user's browser, resulting in faster page load times. There is a convention to add a `min` suffix to minified files. (eg `filename.min.js`)
</aside>

<aside>
  The rendered HTML of the deployed site translates to something like this:

  ```html
  <script src="/assets/application-abcdef1234567890.js"></script>
  ```
  This line in the deployed HTML is responsible for loading your application's JavaScript, ensuring users get the latest version of the script as per the current deployment. You probably noticed the rendered html version includes a fingerprint "abcdef1234567890". This fingerprint is a hash generated based on the file's content for cache-busting purposes.
</aside>

```
app/
  assets/
    config/
      manifest.js
    images/
    stylesheets/
```

#### Sprockets
[Sprockets](https://github.com/rails/sprockets) concatenates JavaScript and CSS files into single files and compresses them to reduce size. This happens server-side, simplifying deployment. Projects using the Asset Pipeline will have the `sprockets-rails` gem in the `Gemfile`. There is a manifest file at `app/assets/config/manifest.js` that indexes all the assets you want to concatenate and minify. `//=` directives are used in `app/assets/config/manifest.js` to include images, stylesheets, and javascript.

```javascript
// app/assets/config/manifest.js

//= link_tree ../images
//= link_directory ../stylesheets .css
//= link_tree ../../javascript .js
```

<!-- TODO:
- limitations of sprockets
  - vendor/
  - versioning of dependencies
- lead into importmaps
-->

#### Importmaps
[Importmaps](https://github.com/rails/importmap-rails) leverage modern browser capabilities to load JavaScript modules directly from the browser at runtime, without the need for compilation or bundling. (Just like how we include [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) or [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) in our `<head>`.)

<!-- basically just es6 imports in the browser -->
- **Use Case**: Suited for simpler applications that require basic JavaScript functionality or want to follow Rails conventions more closely.
- **How It Works**: Importmaps allow the browser to manage JavaScript modules at runtime,  loading them from a CDN (Content Delivery Network). This approach reduces server load and simplifies JavaScript management.
- **Identifying Importmaps**: Look for the `importmap-rails` gem in the `Gemfile` and the presence of `config/importmap.rb` in the project.


<!-- TODO
- chnage to alternative bundling approaches? jsbundling, webpacker, etc.
- sprockets *technically* is transpiling/bundling in a more limited way
-->

### [Bundling](https://github.com/rails/jsbundling-rails)
[Bundling](https://github.com/rails/jsbundling-rails) refers to the process of compiling and packaging multiple JavaScript files into one or a few files. This approach is efficient and reduces the number of requests a browser makes to load a page.
<!-- TODO: Talk about tradeoffs? slower development because of compile step, more difficult to configure, etc. -->
- **Use Case**: Ideal for complex applications that utilize Single Page Application (SPA) JavaScript frameworks (like [React](https://react.dev/) or [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)) or need to handle a variety of NPM packages.
- **How It Works**: Bundling tools like Webpack compile and optimize your JavaScript files during the deployment process, ensuring efficient loading and potentially smaller file sizes.
- **Identifying Bundling**: Projects using bundling will have the `jsbundling-rails` gem in the `Gemfile` and specific configuration or build scripts for the chosen JavaScript bundler (eg [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack), [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/), etc.).

<!-- TODO
- limitations of importmaps and asset pipeline (transpiling)
- discuss API-only backend with SPA frontend 
- would this be considered a sub-set of bundling?
- common at large organizations
-->

### Choosing the Right Approach
- Choose [Bundling](https://github.com/rails/jsbundling-rails) if your project requires integration with Single Page Application (SPA) frameworks like  [React](https://react.dev/) or [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), or handling numerous [NPM packages](https://www.npmjs.com/).
- Choose [Importmaps](https://github.com/rails/importmap-rails) for simpler projects that benefit from less configuration and direct browser handling of JavaScript modules.
<!-- TODO: API-only with SPA -->
- Choose the [Asset Pipeline](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html) if your project aligns with the traditional Rails asset management approach, particularly for less complex JavaScript integrations.

Each method - [Bundling](https://github.com/rails/jsbundling-rails), [Importmaps](https://github.com/rails/importmap-rails), and the [Asset Pipeline](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html) - offers distinct advantages and fits different scenarios in a Rails application. Your choice depends on the specifics of your JavaScript requirements, your preferred development workflow, and the specific needs of your project.

## Practical Example: Toggling Text Visibility
We'll implement a feature where users can toggle the visibility of a paragraph of text on a webpage.

### Part 1: "Vanilla" JavaScript Approach
Using the `onclick` attribute, we can directly attach a click event handler to the button in our HTML.

#### Step 1: Creating the View
Create a view `app/views/pages/home.html.erb` and include an `onclick` handler in the `<button>`:

```erb
<!-- app/views/pages/home.html.erb -->
<p id="my-hidden-text" class="hidden">
  This is hidden text.
</p>

<button onclick="toggleTextVisibility()">Toggle Visibility</button>
```
In this code, the `toggleTextVisibility` function will be called when the button is clicked.

#### Step 2: Adding JavaScript
Define the `toggleTextVisibility` function in a `<script>` tag within the HTML file or in a separate JavaScript file:

```html
<!-- Directly in the HTML file -->
<script>
  function toggleTextVisibility() {
    const text = document.getElementById('my-hidden-text');
    text.classList.toggle('hidden');
  }
</script>
```
Even better, keep the JavaScript separate:

```javascript
// app/javascript/custom/toggle_visibility.js
function toggleTextVisibility() {
  const text = document.getElementById('my-hidden-text');
  text.classList.toggle('hidden');
}
```
And then include it in your `application.js`:

```javascript
// app/javascript/application.js
import "../custom/toggle_visibility"
```

#### Step 3: CSS
Add the CSS for `.hidden`:

```css
/* app/assets/stylesheets/application.css */

.hidden {
  display: none;
}
```

<!-- TODO: add conclusion and a gif of the app -->

### Part 2: Stimulus.js Approach
Stimulus.js is a JavaScript framework designed for Rails applications. It enhances HTML by connecting elements to JavaScript objects via data attributes. JavaScript functionalities are encapsulated in controllers and targets, making the code more organized and maintainable.

#### Step 1: Setting Up Stimulus
Run the command to install Stimulus, if not already done:

1. Add the `stimulus-rails` gem to your `Gemfile`: `gem 'stimulus-rails'`
2. Run `./bin/bundle install`.
3. Run `./bin/rails stimulus:install`

#### Step 2: Creating a Stimulus Controller
Generate a Stimulus controller:

```bash
./bin/rails generate stimulus toggle
```

Edit the controller:

```javascript
// app/javascript/controllers/toggle_hidden_controller.js

import { Controller } from "stimulus";

export default class extends Controller {
  static targets = ["text"]

  toggle() {
    this.textTarget.classList.toggle('hidden');
  }
}
```

#### Step 3: Adjusting the View
Update the HTML to use Stimulus:

```erb
<!-- app/views/pages/home.html.erb -->

<div data-controller="toggle-hidden">
  <p data-toggle-hidden-target="text" class="hidden">
    This is hidden text.
  </p>

  <button data-action="click->toggle#toggle">Toggle Visibility</button>
</div>
```

## Conclusion
In this lesson, you've learned two different ways to add interactive features to your Rails application. The vanilla JavaScript approach offers direct control over the DOM, while [Stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/) provides a more structured and Rails-integrated method. Understanding both allows you to choose the right tool for your project's needs.
